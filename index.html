                Hi I'm Corey Capstick!  I am a production/operations manager from Vaughan Ontario with Russian/German descent.  I am a hobby cellist and photographer as well as a teachers assistant at Toronto, Ontarios oldest Traditional Muay Thai school.  I have joined this program in order to aide myself when pursuing entrepreneurial vocations and intend to use the skills earned in this course to create financially lean businesses by using automation and doing much of the work on my own if possible. 
            </p>
